## Response snapshot

The consolidated `tasks.md` for "AI/Spec-Driven Book – Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" was successfully created at `specs/ai-book-project/tasks.md`. This involved manually extracting details from the user's prompt and individual module `plan.md` files due to an inability to execute PowerShell setup scripts. The tasks are comprehensively organized by modules and chapters, following the specified checklist format.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Consolidated tasks for the AI Book project created.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md for AI Book project.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implement tasks for AI Book project.
- 🧠 Reflection: PowerShell scripts could not be executed; manual setup and file generation were performed for a multi-module project.
- Failure modes observed: Inability to execute PowerShell scripts.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment: N/A
