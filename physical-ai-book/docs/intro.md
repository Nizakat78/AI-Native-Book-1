# Introduction

Welcome to the AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book is an exploration into the exciting world of creating intelligent, embodied agents that can perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.

This book is structured into four main modules:

1.  **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Learn the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the communication backbone of modern robotics.
2.  **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Discover how to create and use high-fidelity simulations to accelerate robotics development.
3.  **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**: Dive into the world of AI-powered robotics, using NVIDIA's powerful simulation and AI tools.
4.  **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Explore the cutting-edge of AI robotics, where Large Language Models are combined with vision and action to create truly intelligent robots.

Throughout this book, we will follow a spec-driven development approach, where we first define the desired behavior of our robotic systems and then implement them. This approach allows us to build complex systems in a structured and manageable way.

We hope you enjoy this journey into the future of robotics!
